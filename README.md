## Installation

### NPM

- Before you proceed with installation, make sure you have npm installed on your machine.
- If not installed, you can simply install it using homebrew on mac (think of other OS?)

``` brew install npm ```

### Clone

- Clone this repo to your local machine using

``` git clone https://github.com/aahmed019/Seinor-Design-2-Fall2020 ```

### Install packages and dependencies
- Execute the following command on your terminal in the directory of where the local repo is found in your machine

``` npm install ```
``` npm install expo-cli ```


## Run on your mobile device

To use Kinnect on your iOS device (Android not supported), install the Expo App. 

Next you need to execute the following command on your terminal ``` expo start ``` or ``` npm start``` in the directory of where the local repo is found in your machine.

Once Expo has completely loaded the application, there will be a QR code which you can use either the Expo application or your iPhones camera to load the app onto your phone.

These steps must be done every time you wish to run the application.

## Cool Expo tips

If for any reason the application crashes, you can shake your phone to open the developer tools. This will allow you to refresh your current instance.

## Ending the Expo Session

Simply closing the tab is sufficent to ending the Expo session and exiting the terminal, however using CTRL + C on your terminal is an alternative.

On your mobile device, the last active session will still be avaiable until you exit the Expo App.
